—This is a simple Arduino-based device that helps enforce social distancing. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to the nearest person or object. If someone comes closer than 1 meter, the buzzer alerts you with a warning sound.
—An LCD screen shows the real-time distance in meters. A push-button lets you toggle the device on and off without unplugging it.

—Hardware used:

1. Arduino Uno
2. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
3. I2C 16x2 LCD
4. Buzzer
5. Push-button

—This was built as a basic safety tool and a fun way to explore sensors, displays, and input handling on Arduino.
